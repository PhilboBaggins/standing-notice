Standing notice
===============

A notice board / sign kind of thing with a stand build in so that it will hold itself up.

The current designs are intended to be laser cut out of a 6 mm thick material like this [macrocarpa hardwood](https://www.ponoko.com/materials/macrocarpa-hardwood) but other materials will work too as long as you change the `thickness` variable in the [OpenSCAD code](./Basic%20shape/StandingNotice.scad).
